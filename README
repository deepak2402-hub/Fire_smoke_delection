# Fire and Smoke Detection with OpenCV

This project is a simple real-time fire and smoke detection system using OpenCV and Python. It uses basic color and image processing techniques to identify potential fire and smoke in video frames from a webcam.

## Features

- **Fire Detection:** Detects fire based on HSV color thresholding (yellow/orange hues).
- **Smoke Detection:** Detects smoke using grayscale differences and thresholding.
- **Real-time Processing:** Processes frames from your webcam in real time and displays detection alerts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the code files.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python fire_smoke_detection.py
```

- A window will open showing your webcam feed.
- If fire or smoke is detected, alerts will appear on the video.
- Press `q` to quit.

## How it Works

- **Fire Detection:**  
  The script converts each frame to HSV color space and applies a mask for colors in the yellow/orange range, which are typical of fire. If enough pixels match, it displays a "Fire Detected!" alert.

- **Smoke Detection:**  
  The script blurs each gray frame, calculates the difference, and thresholds the result to find areas that might be smoke. If enough pixels match, it displays a "Smoke Detected!" alert.

## Limitations

- This is a simple heuristic approach and may not be reliable for safety-critical applications.
- It may produce false positives/negatives depending on the environment, lighting, and camera quality.
- For robust detection, consider using machine learning models or more advanced image processing methods.
